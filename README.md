# Unintentional Non-Fatal Childhood Agricultural Injuries Presenting to United States Emergency Departments, 2000 to 2017

**Author**: Ebuwa Evbuoma-Fike

**Summary**

This analysis presents Phase One of a two-part project examining the childhood agricultural injury system in the United States. In Phase One, I predict the odds of childhood agricultural injury using logistic regression modeling, and, in Phase Two, I calibrate, validate and simulate a moderate-sized simulation model of childhood agricultural injury trends and experiment with the effects of regulatory intervention over a 20-year horizon. These findings have been presented at the 40th International System Dynamics Conference.

**Description**

In the United States, farm work is one of the most dangerous occupations. There are between 200,000 and 300,000 migrant child farmworkers, an especially vulnerable population due to the interplay of factors which impact their health, including family socioeconomic status, fears related to family immigration status and access to healthcare services. Daily, these children encounter diverse hazards during farm work, such as machinery and chemical irritants which increase their risk of injuries. The epidemiology of this public health problem is understudied, partly because there is no single database which documents these injuries at the point of occurrence. The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) annually aggregates nationally representative estimates of non-fatal injuries reported to emergency rooms. This study contributes to the literature by examining trends in farm and home injuries over nearly two decades of data collection, with an emphasis on the causes, characteristics and resulting hospitalizations from these injuries. 

The aim of this analysis is to: 
* compare non-fatal, unintentional injuries in children 18 years and younger occurring on farms to those occurring in residences. 
* examine temporal trends in childhood agricultural injuries between 2000 and 2017
